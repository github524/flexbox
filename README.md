# Company Home Page with Flexbox

## Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!​

You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:

A title and logo or splash image.
A mission statement or brief description of the company.
A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.
